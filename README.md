# Emet

Emet's goal is to test a combat model based around "tokens." These tokens almost entirely encompass a fighter's attributes. They can be both health and skills and armor. A fighter does have the option of various attacks which effect, and are effected, by tokens.

In Emet you control a golem. This golem starts off as a standard clay golem, and can stay a clay golem if you so desire, but can change to three other types:

  * **Clay** - This is the default type. Has advantages against everything but everything has advantages against it.
  * **Flesh** - This type of golem specializes in attacks that ail the opponent. Flesh golems are also good against metal golems via rust.
  * **Stone** - This type of golem specializes in tokens that pull off tricks like dodging and countering. Stone golems are good against flesh golems.
  * **Metal** - The hardiest. This type of golem specializes in a lot of health tokens and strong, consistent attacks. Metal golems are good against stone golems.
